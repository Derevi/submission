# General FAQ for group project goes here for now..

# Naming Conventions for Branches

bug/name          Bug fix or experiment


# Creating and push branches

When working on a feature make sure you create a new branch use command:

``git checkout -b "feature/name"    ..... (ignore quotes)``

To push the branch to remote origin so that it shows up on github use command:

``git push -u origin "feature/name"  ..... (ignore quotes)``

# Before you merge
note before you merge and delete your branch make sure to have fully tested it with master
