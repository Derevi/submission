This folder is where we will put our required documents for the Midterm subission.
Required documents for the Midterm submission are:

Requirements Document
Testing Document
User Manual

Information on what is required for each document is on the Week 4 slides.

Our Lab Task for Feb 4th is for each one of us to pick one of the 3 documents (each have to pick a different 
one), and we have to write a first draft of it.  All documents must be put in this folder and committed to 
GitHub both as source (Word, LaTex, Pages, etc...) and as a PDF.

The actual Midterm Submission is due on Feb 24th.  The Lab Task is just for a first draft of each document.

Lastly, we will use GitHub to share and update these documents throughout the course.
