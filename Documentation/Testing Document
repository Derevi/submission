Describes the test cases that have been implemented
• Includes discussion on how these test cases were
derived

First test cases check the function of the save and load method as well as the buttonCatalog.
A test case was made to ensure that the serialized file is loaded correctly. 
It checks by ensuring the loaded object has the proper state. Assertions will check actual button data.
Another test case was created to ensure that if the file did not exist, that the proper exception was thrown.
These test are sufficient as it only involves two methods, save and load, and the main object of interest is  the button

The next text will assure that the correct buttons are loaded. This will be done by creating a mock button in the gridPane 
upon loading of the button an output will be created and that will be tested with an assertion.

Most of the methods in the provided interface will be tested as well. Most of the methods are getters for state, and will be checked to ensure
the correct state of the objecct.

Another series of text cases will ensure that audiofiles are created upon compile. it will test the count, and name, compared to the amount
of buttons in the catalog
